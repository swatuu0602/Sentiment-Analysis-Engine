# Sentiment Analysis Engine

## Week 1

**07/08/2024** - Started exploring and dedicating the dataset for the project.

**14/08/2024** - Selected IMDB and Twitter datasets for diverse sentiment sources; began preprocessing, including text cleaning and tokenization.

**21/08/2024** - Finalized preprocessing methods; implemented basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns in sentiment distribution.

## Week 2

**28/08/2024** - Researched potential model architectures; decided to use a combination of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) as baselines [[5]

**04/09/2024** - Set up baseline models with hyperparameter tuning; began model evaluation on the validation set.

## Week 3

**11/09/2024** - Transitioned to deep learning models (LSTM and BERT) for comparison against baseline models; started model training.

**18/09/2024** - Trained models completed initial evaluation; results showed LSTM performed best on text length variability and context.

## Week 4

**25/09/2024** - Implemented performance tuning on LSTM model; added additional layers and dropout for enhanced generalization.

**02/10/2024** - Finalized model; began testing on unseen test data to assess model accuracy and robustness.

## Week 5

**09/10/2024** - Integrated model into API for deployment and tested API endpoints for consistency.

## Week 6

**16/10/2024** - Documented findings and prepared final project report, summarizing model performance and sentiment insights.

# Sentiment Analysis Engine Deployment

## Overview

This project involves the deployment of a sentiment analysis engine using a fine-tuned NLP model. The engine is designed to analyze and categorize sentiment from textual input, specifically designed for social media platforms like Twitter. The model was trained using pre-existing datasets and deployed using Flask, with a front-end interface for users to interact with.

## Features

- **Sentiment Prediction**: The engine predicts whether a given text has a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: The engine can analyze live tweets by users based on specific keywords.
- **User Dashboard**: Provides an interactive interface for users to input text and view sentiment analysis results.
- **Model Customization**: The model has been fine-tuned using DistilBERT and RoBERTa base models for improved performance in sentiment analysis tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language for the model and backend.
- **Flask**: Web framework used for deploying the model.
- **DistilBERT and RoBERTa**: Pre-trained NLP models fine-tuned for sentiment analysis.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For the front-end web interface.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For model development and deployment.
